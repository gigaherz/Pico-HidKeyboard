A HID Keyboard implemented using a Raspberry Pi Pico.

The hardware is connected to the keyboard matrix from a 7" tablet cover keyboard.
The matrix has 13 columns and 5 rows, and is fully equipped with anti-ghosting diodes.

While exposing an NKRO interface would be possible given the matrix, I have no need for it.
